Meeting: Product Team Sprint Planning — April 2, 2026
Attendees: Simran (CPO), Marcus (Lead Engineer), Priya (Senior Designer),
           Tom (QA Lead), Diana (DevOps Engineer), Raj (Backend Engineer),
           Aisha (Data Scientist)

[00:00] Simran: Alright everyone, let's get through sprint planning. We have a lot to cover.
Marcus, what is the status on the authentication service refactor?

[00:45] Marcus: Still in progress. There are some edge cases I am working through.
Should be done by end of next week, maybe.

[01:02] Simran: "Maybe" is not a timeline. Can you commit to a specific date?

[01:15] Marcus: Fine. Friday the 10th. But I need Priya's mockups before I can
start on the frontend portion.

[01:28] Simran: Priya, the new dashboard designs are blocking Marcus. Where are you on those?

[01:35] Priya: I can get the core screens done by Wednesday, but I still need
the final copy from — who is handling that again? I thought Raj was.

[01:48] Raj: I thought you were sending me the copy brief, Simran.

[01:52] Simran: I delegated that to you last week, Raj.
Let's say you have it ready by tomorrow EOD.

[02:05] Raj: That is aggressive but okay, I will make it work.

[02:12] Simran: Good. Diana, I have been hearing that our production deploys are
taking forever — like 40 to 45 minutes. We need to look into that.

[02:23] Diana: Yeah, I have noticed it too. It is probably the test suite bloating
the CI pipeline. I will investigate.

[02:35] Simran: Tom, can you work with Diana on pinpointing the slow tests?

[02:40] Tom: Sure, though I am already heads-down on the regression suite for
the auth service. My plate is pretty full right now.

[02:52] Simran: We need both done. Prioritise the deploy investigation.

[02:57] Tom: Alright. I can have a slow-test report ready by Thursday.

[03:08] Simran: Aisha, the model performance dashboard — where are we?

[03:14] Aisha: Completely blocked. I am waiting on the cleaned dataset from
the new data pipeline. Marcus, I asked you about this two weeks ago.

[03:22] Marcus: Oh right, sorry. I can set up the pipeline access today.

[03:29] Simran: Marcus, also — the API documentation needs to be updated
before the external partner review on the 12th.

[03:38] Marcus: The 12th? That is the same week as the auth refactor deadline.
I genuinely do not think I can deliver both at the same quality.

[03:47] Simran: Let us flag that as a risk and figure it out offline.
Priya, we should also think about mobile responsiveness for the dashboard.
Not necessarily this sprint, but at some point.

[04:00] Priya: Do you want me to scope that out?

[04:04] Simran: Not urgently. And speaking of things that need doing —
someone needs to update the staging environment configuration.
It has been running on the old credentials since January.

[04:18] Tom: I can handle that. When do you need it?

[04:22] Simran: Before the auth service gets promoted to staging.
So before Marcus wraps up on the 10th.

[04:28] Tom: Great, another one for the pile.

[04:35] Simran: Last thing, and this is important — Raj, the security team
sent over an audit report flagging SQL injection vulnerabilities in the
user service. That needs to be addressed immediately.

[04:48] Raj: Understood. I will start on it today.

[04:52] Simran: It needs to go through full code review and Tom needs to
sign off on the QA side before it can merge to main. No shortcuts on this one.

[04:59] Tom: Copy that. Tag me when it is ready for review.

[05:05] Simran: Okay. Friday sync to check in on all of this.
Make sure you are all tracking your items.
