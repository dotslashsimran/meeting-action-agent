"""
Partial publish debug run.

8 action items scored — only 7 published.
The 4th notion_publisher call (a Critical security item) fails with a
simulated Notion API rate-limit error. The orchestrator receives the
error string, logs no retry, and moves on.

What the trace surfaces:
  - risk_scorer:        8 items enriched, 1 flagged SECURITY_SENSITIVE + Critical
  - notion_publisher:   8 tool calls visible, call #4 returns an error string
  - sprint_summary:     7 items (the Critical item is missing — no one noticed)

Debug question: "Risk scorer shows 8 items, sprint summary shows 7.
  Which one dropped? Looking at the trace... tool call #4 errored.
  Why didn't the orchestrator retry it?"

Meeting: API Platform Security Review — Sprint Kickoff
Date: April 4, 2026
Attendees: Priya (Engineering Lead), Seb (Backend Engineer), Zoe (Security),
           Marcus (DevOps), Tara (QA Lead), Leon (Product)

[00:00] Priya: Let's move fast. We have the security audit results back and
there are items we need to close before the partner integration goes live.
Everyone needs to leave with a named task and a date.

[00:18] Zoe: First and most urgent — the partner API has no authentication
on the /internal/sync endpoint. Any authenticated user in our system can
call it and read raw partner data. This is a P0. Seb, you need to patch
this today.

[00:32] Seb: Confirmed, I know the endpoint. I'll have a fix up for review
by 3pm.

[00:38] Zoe: Tara, I need you to write a test that would catch this class
of auth bypass — unauthenticated access to internal routes. We cannot rely
on manual review for these.

[00:48] Tara: I can have that test written by end of day alongside Seb's fix.

[00:55] Priya: Good. Marcus — the API gateway access logs are only retained
for 7 days. If this endpoint was being probed before we caught it, we have
no visibility. We need 90-day retention minimum.

[01:10] Marcus: I'll update the log retention config. Done by tomorrow EOD.

[01:18] Leon: On the product side — the partner integration dashboard has no
rate limiting on the data export endpoint. Partners can pull unlimited records.
We have one partner already pulling 500k rows a day. Seb, can you add rate
limiting there too?

[01:32] Seb: Rate limiting on the export endpoint — yes, I can do that.
Give me until Monday.

[01:40] Priya: Zoe, the API keys issued to partners — they never expire.
We have keys from the original pilot two years ago still active.

[01:50] Zoe: That needs to go on the remediation list. I'll write up the
key rotation policy and send it to all active partners. Two weeks — April 18th.

[02:00] Priya: Marcus, while we are on infrastructure — the staging environment
is running the old API gateway version. The security patches from last month
never got applied to staging. That needs to match prod.

[02:12] Marcus: I'll do a full staging sync this week, Thursday.

[02:20] Tara: One more from QA — we have no automated regression suite for
the auth layer. Every time someone touches auth code we are relying on
manual spot checks. Given today's finding, that is clearly not enough.

[02:32] Priya: Tara, scope out an auth regression suite. When can you
have a first pass?

[02:38] Tara: First pass by April 11th. I will need Seb to review the
test cases for the internal endpoint logic.

[02:48] Priya: Seb, flag that as a dependency. Okay — everyone has an item.
Let's close this out.
