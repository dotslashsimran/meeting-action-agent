"""
Three-agent pipeline.

  meeting_analyst      → pure LLM — extracts action items as structured JSON
  risk_scorer_agent    → calls risk_scorer tool (deterministic Python scorer)
  notion_orchestrator  → calls notion_publisher tool (one call per item)

Trace topology:
  meeting_analyst     → 1-2 LLM calls
  risk_scorer_agent   → 1 LLM call + 1 tool call (risk_scorer)
  notion_orchestrator → 1 LLM call + N tool calls (notion_publisher, one per item)
